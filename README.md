a simple Python script that encodes data from **"data.txt**" file

### Heres how it works :

#### Encoder : 
it uses three custom dictionaries to encode strings
it chooses the Dictionary randomly and puts a Dictionary identifier number at the beginning of the encoded string

then it encodes the encoded data with hexadecimals and outputs it into **"encdata.txt"**

#### Decoder : 
decoder imports encoded data from **"encdata.txt"**
identifies which Dictionary was used
decodes the data and outputs it into **"decdata.txt"**

### Notes : 

currently only supports english
